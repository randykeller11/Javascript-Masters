<h1>Javascript Masters<h1>
<h4>Control Tiger Woods front 9 at Augusta by answering some tricky Javascript trivia!</h4>  

<p>
I decided to build this game to practice my skills with application building. I encourage everyone to look at the wiki on this repository for an in depth explanation of the game design. I hope you enjoy playing the game and I am currently refactoring it to run on a node.js server. Currently all the videos are loaded at once in the beginning so make sure the game is fully loaded before you start. Hit em' straight and go get that green jacket!!
